General Information
===================================

The package in `kgcnn <https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras/tree/master/kgcnn>`__ contains several layer classes to build up graph convolution models in
Keras with Tensorflow, PyTorch or Jax as backend. Some models are given as an example in literature.
Focus of kgcnn is (batched) graph learning for molecules **kgcnn.molecule** and materials **kgcnn.crystal**.
Below you can find explanations and information on how to use `kgcnn <https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras/tree/master/kgcnn>`__ .
