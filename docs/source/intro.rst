Introduction
============


The package in `kgcnn <https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras/tree/master/kgcnn>`__ contains several layer classes to build up graph convolution models.
Some models are given as an example.

The version of **kgcnn>=4.0.0** are developed for **keras>=3.0** and should enable graph neural networks with multi-backend support.
The currently supported backends are `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`__ , `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`__ and `Jax <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__ .

All models and layers of kgcnn
